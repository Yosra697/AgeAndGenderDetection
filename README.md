# Age and Gender Detection

The Age and Gender Detection project is designed to predict the age and gender of individuals based on facial images. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system processes facial data to provide accurate and simultaneous predictions of age and gender.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the UTKFace dataset from Kaggle, which contains diverse facial images labeled with age and gender information.

## Machine Learning Techniques
The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction, employing a multi-output model to predict both age and gender simultaneously.
